Based on the project description, create a crew (a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks) 
specifying the team members and their responsibilities for the CrewAI framework. 
CrewAI is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents, enabling you to create AI 
teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals, working together to accomplish complex tasks. 
Think of it as assembling your dream team - each member (agent) brings unique skills and expertise, 
collaborating seamlessly to achieve your objectives. Determine the optimal composition and number of agents 
needed to accomplish the given task efficiently, without excess.

For each agent in the crew, describe the following:
- **Role**: Define the agent’s function and expertise within the crew.
- **Goal**: Outline the individual objective that guides the agent’s decision-making.
- **Description**: Provide context and personality to the agent, enriching interactions.

Detail the tasks as follows:
- **Name**: A name identifier for the task.
- **Description**: A clear, concise statement of what the task entails.
- **Expected Outcome**: A detailed description of what the task’s completion looks like.
- **Agent**: Identify the agent responsible for executing the task.

# What is a God Task?

A God Task is a single task that tries to do too much.  
At first, it might look simple, but when you dig deeper, you find it's made up of many smaller tasks bundled together.

## Why God Tasks are a Problem?

1. **Agents Lose Focus**: They struggle to understand the full scope and lose track of the ultimate goal.  
2. **Skipped Steps**: Sub-tasks can be overlooked, even if you've defined them.  
3. **Incomplete Results**: The output may not meet expectations due to missed details or confusions.  


## Key Signs of a God Task

1. **Too Many Steps**: What looks like one task is actually several steps hidden inside.  
2. **Too Broad**: It tries to cover a lot of work in one go.  
3. **Confusing**: Because it combines so much, it's hard to understand or follow.  
4. **Hard to Debug**: If the task fails, it's tough to figure out where the problem is because everything is lumped together.  

## How to Fix a God Task?

1. **Break it Into Smaller Tasks**: Divide the God Task into clear, manageable steps that each focus on one specific goal.  
2. **Define Clear Inputs & Outputs**: Ensure each smaller task has a well-defined input and produces a clear output.  
3. **Use Context Strategically**: Pass relevant details from one task as input to the next, so the agent always has the information.  
###

# Steps

1. Review the project description to understand the nature of tasks required.
2. Based on the tasks, decide on the necessary roles and expertise needed within the crew.
3. Create agents with specific roles, goals, and detailed descriptions, ensuring they align with the tasks.
4. Break down the tasks into smaller, manageable components and assign them to the agents.
5. Ensure that the collective effort of the agents leads to an efficient workflow and successful task completion.

# Output Format

Provide a structured list of agents, including their roles, goals, and descriptions. Follow this with a detailed breakdown of tasks, including task names, descriptions, expected outcomes, and the assigned agent.

# Examples

**Agent Example**  
- **Role**: [Project Manager]  
- **Goal**: [To ensure the timely and efficient completion of the project.]  
- **Description**: [A meticulous planner with a knack for problem-solving and a decisive attitude.]  

**Task Example**  
- **Name**: [Develop Project Timeline]  
- **Description**: [Create a comprehensive timeline for the project phases.]  
- **Expected Outcome**: [A detailed timeline document outlining all project phases, milestones, and deadlines.]  
- **Agent**: [Project Manager]

# Notes

- Be mindful of available resources when creating the crew; ensure agents have complementary skills for collaboration.
- Consider the balance between agent specialization and versatility to enhance efficiency.
